Theme details:\
A better search engine for education 

Users can ask any educational question or choose any micro-topic they want to learn and \
they will be shown the best related educational content categorised by platform: \
Twitter threads, Quora answers, brainly answers, wikipedia articles, reddit posts, third-party websites, etc. 

Users can contribute more resources, upvote good resources, downvote bad resources 

Build a distraction-free zone for students to learn from the best educational content from around the Internet.


## How will you solve the problem?
1. Why To Use Kudosearch? \
You may have faced an issue where you do a Google search for a question and it costs you almost 3-4 searches to find the \ 
solution you were actually looking for, but with LearningX that's not the case. \

KudoSearch is optimized for students to find educational content effortlessly. All the pages which will rank on Kudosearch will \ 
only be coming from trusted sources, and all the pages will be ranked organically through it's search algorithm, Color. Color is \
a search algorithm which was recycled from one of my old search engines, Cpix, after some major changes in the search algorithm it now ranks \
only educational content onto it's results page.

Now obviously it's nearly impossible to beat Google, but as Kudosearch is highly focused to Organise Educational Content at one place, it's in a lead. 

2. Is KudoSearch Safe? \
Yes, Kudosearch is totally safe to use, it neither collects your data nor tracks you, and if you still doubt you can review LearningX's source code. 

3. Is KudoSearch Free? \
Yes, Kudosearch is totally free and it's open source too. So, if you want then you can download it's source code and contribute to it.
